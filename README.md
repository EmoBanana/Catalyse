## Basic Troubleshooting

## Powered by Machine Learning

Catalyse leverages a custom ML model trained on a synthetic business dataset to deliver smart recommendations and adaptive insights. 
- **The Model Content Protocol (MCP)** ensures that the AI system remains context-aware, retaining relevant business and user information across interactions for more coherent, on-point suggestions.
- **Meta Prophet** powers our forecasting capabilities, providing accurate trend predictions through detailed graphs, enabling merchants to make proactive, data-backed decisions. 
The system evolves with usage, continuously learning and fine-tuning its responses to better align with each merchant's unique operations.
